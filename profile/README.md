# Welcome to LetsGainit 👋

LetsGainit is a collaborative platform connecting **Gainers** (developers), **Mentors** (experienced developers), and **Nonprofit Organizations** to work together on meaningful, impactful projects.

## 🚀 Our Mission

LetsGainit exists to empower developers to **gain real-world experience** and **enrich their portfolios** by collaborating on meaningful, impactful projects. Our platform connects passionate developers (“Gainers”), experienced mentors, and nonprofits in need—giving everyone the opportunity to learn, contribute, and grow.

We believe in the power of open collaboration to drive social good. By bridging the gap between passionate developers and organizations in need, we foster a community where learning, mentorship, and positive change go hand in hand.
